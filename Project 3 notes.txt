ls -ial  (print out inode numbers)

ls -l /etc/ACL

printout the row contents of the ACL as you read through it (so we know what's in it)

do_chacl
	- filename, id (uid/gid), g_or_u, mode (+RW/R)  (all from the system call)
	- look up vnode for the file (in test.c)
	- look up vnode for ACL (/etc/ACL)
	- use code for do_chmod for the lookups
	- permissions check
	- check the ACL for identical entry (file and uid/gid match) (update check) -> add new entry
	- OR modify existing entry with new 
	- return resources
	- 
	
modify forbidden to enforce our ACL

inode | ryan | X |
      |      |   |
